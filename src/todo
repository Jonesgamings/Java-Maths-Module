- Simpsons Rule?
- Make Derivative more efficient / Make simplify work better

- Matrix Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
- Add more taylor series (kinda done?)
- Add log rules to simplification function
- Add simplification to simplify functions (a * a = a^2)

- Add Wedge Product
- Add Bivectors / Trovectors ...
- Add Vector spaces
- Tensors
- Vector Space/Fields
- Spacetime algebra?
- Outer and Inner product
- YAY multivectors

- Refactor code in either another language to allow operator overloading or Overhaul system to have a "CustomNumber" class which all maths data storage class implement from so they can all interact;
