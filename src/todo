- Simpsons Rule?
- Make Derivative more efficient / Make simplify work better

- base.Matrix Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
- Add more taylor series (kinda done?)
- Add log rules to simplification function
- Add simplification to simplify functions (a * a = a^2)

- Add Vector spaces
- Tensors
- Vector Space/Fields
- Outer and Inner product

- allow for just Ln() and Log() in compiler
- Fix bug in graph package for adjaceny matrix
